It integrates 300+ AI models from major providers like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and supports local models via Ollama and LM Studio. Beyond AI Assistants, Cherry Studio features powerful Agent capabilities - autonomous AI that can think, plan, and act.

        "question": "Is Cherry Studio free?",
        "answer": "Yes, Cherry Studio Community Edition is completely free and open-source under the AGPL-3.0 license. You can use it for personal purposes without any cost. For commercial use, please comply with the AGPL license requirements or contact us for an enterprise license."
