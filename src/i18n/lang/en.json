        {
          "question": "Is Express Edition really a one-time payment for lifetime use? Are there other costs?",
          "answer": "Yes, ¥5,000 for permanent software license, plus ¥5,000 for initial model usage credits. Subsequent model fees are deducted based on actual usage. From the second year, you can optionally pay ¥1,000/year for updates and technical support - the software remains usable even without this."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does \"unlimited seats\" mean I can create accounts for any number of people? Will it affect performance?",
          "answer": "Yes, one license supports unlimited employees within your company without per-seat fees. Performance mainly depends on your server configuration, not the number of users."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between Express Edition and Community Edition?",
          "answer": "Three key differences: 1) Express has built-in model services, ready to use; 2) Provides enterprise features like employee management and shared knowledge base; 3) Offers official paid technical support. Community Edition is mainly for personal use."
        },
        {
          "question": "What models are built into Express Edition? Can I add my own?",
          "answer": "Built-in models include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and other top closed-source models, plus DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen and other quality Chinese models. Express Edition doesn't support adding custom models - choose Enterprise Premium for this need."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the server requirements for private deployment?",
          "answer": "Typically a basic cloud server or physical server (e.g., 4 cores, 8GB RAM) is sufficient. Official deployment documentation is provided, or choose Tencent Cloud deployment which requires almost no professional DevOps knowledge."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is data security guaranteed?",
