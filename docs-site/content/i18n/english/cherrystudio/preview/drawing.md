# Painting

The Paintings page is Cherry Studio's built-in **text-to-image tool**: describe what you want in words and get an image back, much like web services such as Midjourney or DALL·E. **Its main advantage is that it reuses the provider accounts you have already configured in Cherry Studio**, so you don't need to sign up for each platform separately.

## Open Paintings

Click **+** on the right side of the top tab bar to open the **Launchpad**, then click **Paintings**.

The page consists of these parts:

* **Canvas list (left)**: thumbnails of your canvases, arranged vertically. Click `+` at the top to create a new canvas and switch to a new group
* **Canvas (middle)**: shows the image currently being generated
* **Input area (bottom)**: the prompt box, with a **provider and model selector** on one side. Below it, a hint tells you whether the current provider has any image models available; if not, a green `Go to Settings` button takes you straight to that provider's configuration page
* **Generate / Edit**: there is no separate toggle — **the selected model decides**. Choose a text-to-image model (such as `qwen-image`) to generate; choose an image-editing model (such as `qwen-image-edit`) to edit, which means uploading an image first and then describing the changes

After you select an **image-editing model** (such as `qwen-image-edit`), the input area switches to an "upload an image + describe the edit" mode.

## Supported Providers

Painting in Cherry Studio relies on the **image models** offered by each provider. The model dropdown lists every option currently available to you, grouped by provider:

<figure><img src="../../../../assets/8d2371cb01853bb1368c6cc0.webp" alt="Paintings model dropdown with a search box and image models grouped by provider"><figcaption><p>The model dropdown lists available image models by provider, with a search box at the top and "Configure custom models" at the bottom</p></figcaption></figure>

They fall roughly into three groups:

| Type | Provider | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud services in China | **[SiliconFlow](../../pre-basic/providers/siliconcloud.md)** | Easiest to access from mainland China, low prices, wide model choice |
| | **PPIO** | Cloud compute service in China |
| | **Zhipu Open Platform** | Chinese model CogView |
| Aggregation gateways | **AiHubMix** | Gateway aggregating multiple vendors |
| | **DMXAPI** | Gateway aggregating multiple vendors |
| | **TokenFlux** | Overseas gateway |
| | **CherryIN** | Cherry's official gateway with unified billing |
| | **AiOnly** | Third-party gateway |
| Self-hosted / local | **New API** | Self-hosted gateway; appears in this list once added |
| | **OVMS** | OpenVINO Model Server for local inference (shown only while OVMS is running) |

{% hint style="info" %}
Any custom provider whose **endpoint type is set to `Image Generation (OpenAI)`** appears here automatically. More providers will be added over time.
{% endhint %}

## Start Painting

1. Select a configured **provider and model** in the input area. If you see "No image generation models available", click `Go to Settings` and add a model with the endpoint type **Image Generation (OpenAI)** under that provider
2. Choose a **text-to-image model** (such as `qwen-image`) and type a **prompt** in the input box (Chinese or English both work — the more specific, the better), for example:
   ```
   An orange cat wearing round glasses sitting on a pile of books, vintage oil painting style, warm dusk light
   ```
3. Adjust the parameters (size, steps, seed, etc.). If you're unsure, keep the defaults
4. Click **Generate** and wait a few seconds to a few tens of seconds, depending on the model
5. The generated image appears on the canvas, where you can download it, favorite it, or generate another one with one click

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't want to pick a model in the input area every time? Go to **Settings → Default Model → Painting Model** and set a default **image generation model** (described as "the model used for image generation"). Paintings will then use it by default.
{% endhint %}

## How to Fill In the Parameters

Some fields in the parameter panel have an **ⓘ info icon** on the right; hover over it to see an explanation (providers such as SiliconFlow, AiHubMix and PPIO mostly have these). However, **not every provider** includes tooltips — the Zhipu and NewAPI panels, for example, have none. If there's no explanation, just try the defaults below.

If you want to go deeper:

* **Size**: affects the amount of detail and the generation time. 1024x1024 is enough for everyday use
* **Steps**: how many times the model "refines" the image. 20–30 steps is usually enough; more gives diminishing returns
* **CFG / Guidance**: how closely the AI follows your prompt. 7–12 is a common range
* **Seed**: a fixed seed makes results reproducible; leave it empty to see random variations of the same prompt

## Tips and Tricks

* **English prompts usually work better** (most models are trained mainly on English data)
* Be specific: include the style, composition, lighting and camera angle
* Want to "edit based on a reference image"? Check whether your provider supports **img2img** (image-to-image)
* Generate 4 images at once to save time: set the "batch count" to 4

{% hint style="info" %}
The Paintings feature expands with each release. The dropdown in the app always shows the currently supported providers.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Gemini image models (such as `gemini-2.5-flash-image`) can be selected directly in the Paintings model dropdown once a Gemini-compatible provider is configured. You can also generate images with them in a regular chat.
{% endhint %}
