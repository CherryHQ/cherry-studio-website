# Coding Companion

【Coding Companion】is used to install, configure, and launch common programming command-line tools. Cherry Studio recognizes its own managed installations and also detects CLIs already available in the system login environment. System tools remain managed by their original package managers.

<figure><img src="../../../../assets/565c03d38bfd4fabef8d3013.webp" alt="Installation status, version check, and Code CLI provider on the Coding Partner page"><figcaption><p>First, confirm that the tool is installed and the version is available, then configure the model connection and project directory. </p></figcaption></figure>

## What the Page Does

* Checks if the tool is installed and if updates are available;
* Installs or updates Cherry Studio-managed tool copies;
* Detects tools already present in the system PATH;
* Selects a provider and model for CLIs that require model services;
* Preserves native login methods for CLIs that use their own account login;
* Launches the tool after selecting a working directory and a system-detected terminal.

The page currently includes tools such as Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Kimi Code, Qoder CLI, and GitHub Copilot CLI. The visible items may change with product updates; refer to the page list for the current availability.

## Usage Flow

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### 1. Open 【Coding Companion】 in the Left Navigation

Select the required tool and check its status: not installed, managed by Cherry Studio, or from the system.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Complete Installation or Login

If not installed, click 【Install】. For CLIs that provide their own account login, follow the page prompts to complete native login. You do not need to select a provider from Cherry Studio.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Configure Model Connection

For tools requiring Cherry Studio model services, select a compatible provider and model. The page filters providers based on the interface type required by the CLI; incompatible providers are not listed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Select Directory and Terminal

The working directory determines where the CLI launches. The terminal can only be selected from the list of system-detected terminals; custom terminal executable file paths are no longer provided.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 5. Launch and Verify

Click 【Launch】 and run a read-only check in the terminal. Confirm that the account, model, and directory are correct before executing file modifications or commands.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Claude Code Model Modes

When configuring Claude Code, 【Model】 offers two modes:

* 【General】: All requests use the same model, offering simple configuration;
* 【Detailed】: Set Fable, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, and Subagent separately in 【Model Role Mapping】. The 【Actual Request Model】 in the table is the model ultimately used for each role; you can also enable 【1M】 context for specific roles if needed.

Use 【Detailed】 only when you specifically need to assign different models to roles such as background subtasks, compression, or titles. Roles left blank will follow the main model. After making changes, use a small task to confirm that each role can request normally.

## Use Case: Launching Coding Tools in a Project Directory

| Selection | Recommended Starting Point | Applicable Scenario | Notes |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Installation Source | Use the existing system version if available | Teams that already manage CLIs centrally | Updates and uninstallation remain the responsibility of the original package manager |
| Model Connection | First select a connection already verified as available in Cherry Studio | CLIs that require model services | Tools with native account login should follow the native login flow |
| Working Directory | Select only the current project directory | Modifying code, running checks | Confirm the terminal's current path after launching |
| First Command | Read-only view of project status | Verifying account, model, and directory | Allow file writing only after confirmation |

### Completion Criteria

The page identifies the installation source; the terminal opens in the correct directory; the minimal read-only command succeeds; and the account or model displayed by the tool matches expectations.

## Distinguish Installation Sources

| Source | What Cherry Studio Does | How You Should Maintain It |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Cherry Studio Managed | Installs, updates, and uninstalls the corresponding managed copy | Manage in 【Coding Companion】 or 【Environment Dependencies】 |
| System PATH | Detects and uses directly without overriding | Update or uninstall using the original package manager |
| App Built-in | Uses directly, does not provide system-level uninstallation | Updates with Cherry Studio |

{% hint style="warning" %}
After uninstalling a Cherry Studio-managed copy, if a same-named executable file still exists in the system, the page will automatically fall back to the system version. When versions or behaviors change, first confirm which source is currently in use.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Why can't I find an already installed terminal or CLI? </summary>

Cherry Studio detects tools from the login environment and standard locations. Ensure the command can run in a login terminal, then restart the application to refresh the environment. Portable or non-standard paths currently need to be launched manually from that terminal.
