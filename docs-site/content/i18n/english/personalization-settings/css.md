# Custom CSS

With custom CSS you can change how the app looks without touching the source code, and tailor the interface to your taste — for example, changing the font, the theme color, or the background of message bubbles.

### Where to Set It

Open **Settings → Appearance** and find the **Custom CSS** code box at the bottom of the page. Styles you write there take effect immediately. Leave it empty to load no custom styles.

The CSS you write is injected as-is into the `<head>` of every window, as a `<style id="user-defined-custom-css">` element. Because it isn't part of the app's internal cascade layers, your styles take precedence over the built-in ones for the same selector, so most ordinary declarations work without `!important`.

### A Working Example

The snippet below uses only variables and selectors that actually exist in the current app:

```css
/* 1. Global font */
body {
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
}

/* 2. Theme color and user message bubble background (light theme / default) */
:root {
  --primary: #1a8f5a;
  --chat-user: rgba(26, 143, 90, 0.08);
}

/* 3. Separate overrides for the dark theme (the root element gets the .dark class in dark mode) */
.dark {
  --primary: #28b561;
  --chat-user: rgba(40, 181, 97, 0.12);
}

/* 4. Change the background color of the main content area directly */
#content-container {
  background-color: #f6f4ec;
}
```

### About Theme Variables

The app describes its colors with a set of CSS custom properties (variables). Light theme defaults are defined on `:root`, and dark theme overrides on `.dark` — when you switch to the dark theme, the root element gets the `.dark` class. So to style light and dark separately, write your rules under the `:root` and `.dark` selectors, not the old `theme-mode` attribute selector.

Commonly used public variables include:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--background` / `--foreground` | Main background / main foreground (text) color |
| `--primary` / `--primary-foreground` | Theme color / text color on the theme color |
| `--card` / `--popover` | Background of cards and popovers |
| `--muted` / `--muted-foreground` | Muted background / muted text color |
| `--border` / `--input` / `--ring` | Border, input and focus ring colors |
| `--sidebar` series | Sidebar colors |
| `--chat-user` | User message bubble background |
| `--link` | Link color |
| `--code-block` / `--inline-code` | Code block / inline code background |
| `--font-family` / `--code-font-family` | Global font / code font |
| `--radius` | Base corner radius |

### Pasting an Old Stylesheet

If you paste a stylesheet written for an older version that isn't compatible with the current interface, the app may disable it automatically and show a notice in the Custom CSS area. Adapt the styles to the current variables and selectors first, then remove the marker on the first line as prompted to re-enable it.
