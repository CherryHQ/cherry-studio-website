# Work / Agents

**Work** (also called **Agents**) is the system in Cherry Studio that can **call tools on its own, read and write files, and complete tasks across multiple steps** — it's not the same thing as a chat assistant, which is just a role preset. You'll find it under **Work in the left navigation bar** (not the top tab used in older tutorials).

The easiest way to use it: tell the Agent what you want to accomplish and let it check for itself which models, tools, knowledge bases or channels are missing. Adjust things manually only when you need precise control.
{% endhint %}

## What It Can Do

* **Read and write files**: give it a **working directory** and it can read, edit and create files there.
* **Call tools**: built-in tools, plus the [Skills](extensions/skills.md) and external [MCP](extensions/mcp) tools you attach.
* **Multi-step reasoning / subtasks**: break down a goal, dispatch sub-agents, and run background commands.
* **Plug into automation**: deploy it to IM platforms with [Channels](automation/channels.md), or run it on a schedule with [Scheduled Tasks](automation/scheduled-heartbeat.md).

## Quick Start

1. Open **Work** and choose an Agent. If you don't have one, click **Add Agent** and create one in four steps (Basic info / System Prompt / Skills / Knowledge). The built-in **Cherry Assistant** is ready to use.
2. If the task involves local files, choose a **working directory**; otherwise the default workspace is fine.
3. Describe the task in terms of "what should be delivered, which materials can be used, and what counts as done".
4. Follow **status / files / subtasks / message stream** in the right panel; with developer mode on, you can also see the **trace**.

## Permission Modes

When an Agent works with files or commands, you can choose one of five permission modes, from most cautious to most hands-off: **Ask Before Acting / Plan Only / Auto-accept Edits / Approve for Me / Full Access**. Use the more hands-off modes only for unattended runs (such as Channels or Scheduled Tasks).
