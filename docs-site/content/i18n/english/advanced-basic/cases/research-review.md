# Multi-Model Research Review

A product team is preparing for a quarterly review: internal materials are complete, but public information needs to be supplemented, and perspectives from different models must be compared. The final deliverable is a research report that allows verification against sources and clearly distinguishes facts from judgments.

## Recommended Setup

* [Chat] Multi-Model: Identify consensus, disagreements, and omissions;
* Research Agent: Advance tasks, break down subtasks, and generate reports;
* Knowledge Base: Retrieve internal materials;
* Web Search or trusted MCP: Supplement external sources;
* Working Directory: Store raw materials and final outputs.

## Workflow

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### 1. Compare Perspectives with the Same Question

Select multiple models in [Chat] and ask each to list conclusions, assumptions, sources, and uncertainties. Organize genuine conflicts into research questions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Create a Research Agent

Bind relevant knowledge bases and research skills. Keep permissions set to [Confirm Each Time]. In the working directory, separate raw materials from the `report/` output directory.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Assign Subtasks

Have the Agent check the factual timeline, data changes, and external perspectives separately. The main Agent then compares conflicts. Retain unconfirmed information as pending verification; do not force merging.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Generate Report and Manual Review

The report should include conclusions, sources, uncertainties, and next steps. Check citations, dates, and figures in the [Files] panel on the right before publishing.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Example Task

```
Review the project materials in the current directory and supplement with public information. Separate facts, judgments, and recommendations; retain source links for external information. Check the timeline, data, and risks separately, and finally generate the report at report/review.md. Do not modify files in raw/.
```

## Preparation and Completion Criteria

| Item | Recommended Preparation |
| ---- | ------------------------------- |
| Research Question | Clearly state the conclusion to be compared in one sentence |
| Source Requirements | Specify time range, region, and acceptable sources |
| Recommended Setup | Use multi-model comparison to collect differences, branches for follow-up, and notes to save confirmed conclusions |
| Completion Criteria | Every key conclusion can be traced back to a source; disagreements are listed separately; unconfirmed content is not presented as fact |

This case is suitable for research requiring perspective comparison and decision process review. It is not suitable for treating multi-model voting directly as factual judgment.

{% hint style="danger" %}
High-risk topics such as finance, healthcare, and law cannot rely solely on model conclusions. Reports should retain sources and be reviewed by individuals with relevant experience or qualifications.
