# Application Cases

These cases demonstrate how to combine conversations, Agents, knowledge bases, notes, image generation, translation, channels, scheduled tasks, and multi-window workflows into processes that deliver real results. The configurations in these cases are starting points; adjust them based on data sensitivity, usage volume, and team policies.

## Choosing a Case by Task

| Your Task | Recommended Case | Key Capabilities |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Compare perspectives and preserve the research process | [Multi-Model Research Review] | Conversations, branches, notes |
| Review large volumes of material and output feedback | [Long Document Review] | Agent, working directory, files |
| Deliver project documents and artifacts | [Agent Project File Delivery] | Agent, state, files |
| Generate a set of stylistically consistent images | [Brand Image Kit] | Agent image generation, image templates |
| Answer only based on internal materials | [Private Knowledge Base QA] | Knowledge base, retrieval testing, Agent |
| Organize weekly reports from scattered notes | [Notes to Weekly Report] | Notes, Agent, files |
| Organize multilingual files | [Multilingual Material Organization] | Translation, Agent, working directory |
| Send fixed reports on a schedule | [Channels and Scheduled Daily Reports] | Agent, channels, scheduled tasks |
| Monitor materials and long-running tasks simultaneously | [Multi-Window Research Workbench] | Tabs, multi-window, global search |

{% step %}
### 1. Define the Deliverable

Specify the final file, table, image, or message required, and define the criteria for completion.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Run Manually in [Work]

Verify that the model, prompts, working directory, and materials are sufficient. Check each operation that requires approval.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Solidify Only Stable Parts

Turn repeated steps into skills, store long-term materials in the knowledge base, and keep temporary requirements in task prompts.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Add External Connections and Automation Last

After completing one manual acceptance test, integrate MCP, channels, or scheduled tasks, and retain a manual fallback entry for failures.
{% endstep %}
