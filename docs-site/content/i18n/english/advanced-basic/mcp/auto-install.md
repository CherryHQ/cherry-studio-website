# Automatic MCP Installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
Automatic MCP installation requires Cherry Studio to be upgraded to v1.1.18 or higher.
{% endhint %}

## Feature Overview

In addition to manual installation, Cherry Studio also comes with the built-in `@mcpmarket/mcp-auto-install` tool, which provides a more convenient way to install MCP servers. You simply need to enter the corresponding commands in a large model conversation that supports MCP services.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Testing Phase Reminder:**

*   `@mcpmarket/mcp-auto-install` is currently still in the testing phase.
*   The effectiveness depends on the "intelligence" of the large model; some parameters will be added automatically, while others still **need to be manually changed in the MCP settings**.
*   Currently, the search source is from @modelcontextprotocol, which can be configured by yourself (explained below).
{% endhint %}

## Usage Instructions

For example, you can enter:

```
Install a filesystem mcp server for me
```

The system will automatically recognize your needs and complete the installation using `@mcpmarket/mcp-auto-install`. This tool supports various types of MCP servers, including but not limited to:

*   filesystem
*   fetch
*   sqlite
*   etc.

> The MCP_PACKAGE_SCOPES variable allows you to customize the MCP service search source. The default value is `@modelcontextprotocol`, which can be configured as needed.
