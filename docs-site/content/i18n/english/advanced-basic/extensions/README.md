# Extending Agent Capabilities

Agents come with built-in tools for files, search, images, memory, workflows, and scheduled tasks. Add skills when you need fixed working methods, and add MCP when you need to connect to external systems. They solve different problems, so you don't need to install everything just to have "more features."

## Determine What You Need First

| Requirement | Choice |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Fixed steps, templates, or checklists | Skills |
| Querying databases, browsers, or third-party systems | MCP |
| Retrieving your own documentation | Knowledge Base |
| Reading/writing current project files, generating images, or sending notifications | Agent built-in tools |

{% hint style="success" %}
The most convenient approach is to describe your goal directly in [Work] and let the Agent help you determine whether you need a skill, MCP, or knowledge base. If you need to verify sources, connection parameters, or permissions, go to [Settings] to manage them manually.
{% endhint %}

## Final Step After Installation

A global installation or successful connection does not mean every Agent can use it. Open [Work] → Agent menu → [Edit], and select from [Skills], [MCP], or [Knowledge Base] respectively. Configuration takes effect from the next message.
