# Skills and Capability Library

A skill is a set of reusable work instructions and supporting resources. It does not connect to external systems; instead, it tells the Agent which process, standards, and format to follow to complete a task.

{% hint style="success" %}
When you need a specific working method, first state your goal to the Agent in [Work] and ask it to find or install an appropriate skill. Open [Settings] → [Skills] only when you need to verify sources, manage skills in bulk, or import from local files.
{% endhint %}

### Install Skills

Manual path: [Settings] → [Skills].

The page supports four sources:

* Search the online skill registry;
* Select [GitHub] in the online search and paste the link to a skill's `SKILL.md` file;
* Install from a local ZIP file;
* Install from a folder containing `SKILL.md`.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### 1. Confirm the Purpose

Describe in one sentence the problem you want the skill to solve, for example, "organize meeting notes into decisions, owners, and deadlines." Similar names do not imply identical processes; review the description before installing.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### 2. Check Source and Content

Open the skill details to confirm what it instructs the Agent to do, whether it includes scripts, and if it requires additional tools or external accounts. Do not use skills from unknown sources directly on sensitive directories.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### 3. Bind to Agent

First, ensure the skill's global switch is enabled in [Settings] → [Skills]. Then, go to [Work] → Agent menu → [Edit] → [Skills] to enable it for this specific Agent. Skill toggles are automatically saved with the Agent configuration and take effect from the next message.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### 4. Verify with Real Tasks

Provide the Agent with a small sample to check if the steps, output format, and boundaries meet expectations before using it for batch or scheduled tasks.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Global Enablement vs. Agent Enablement

<figure><img src="../../../../assets/a05d3125f16b5cb41dd2e05b.webp" alt="Global enable switch and installed skills list on the Skills settings page"><figcaption><p>① The switch on the right side of the card controls whether the skill is available to all Agents; if turned off, the skill will no longer appear in the Agent edit window. </p></figcaption></figure>

| Status | Effect | When to Use |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Globally Enabled | Makes the skill appear in the Agent's available skill directory | The skill source is trusted and may be used by one or more Agents |
| Globally Disabled | Pauses all Agents from using the skill but retains the installed content | Temporary suspension, troubleshooting, or awaiting security checks |
| Agent Enabled | Allows only the current Agent to load the skill | The process aligns with the current Agent's long-term responsibilities |

Turning off the global switch does not uninstall the skill; after re-enabling it, you must still check the enablement status for each Agent. Uninstalling removes the skill content and cleans up associations.

### Choosing Between Skills, Prompts, and MCP

| Need | Choose | Reason |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| A one-off requirement | Current task prompt | No need to add long-term configuration |
| Reusing the same process multiple times | Skill | Can store instructions, templates, and resources simultaneously |
| Defining the Agent's long-term role | Agent system prompt | Must be followed for every task |
| Accessing databases or external services | MCP | Skills themselves do not provide connection capabilities |

### User Case: Team Weekly Report Skill

The team wrote a skill defining the weekly report sections, tone, data checks, and prohibited phrases, and bound it to the "Weekly Report" Agent. Each week, they only need to provide this week's materials, and the Agent outputs a fixed structure according to the skill. When data comes from external systems, they combine it with MCP instead of writing account and API details into the skill body.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Uninstalling a skill removes it from the global capability library and cleans up associations in the Agent workspace. Confirm that no tasks are currently using the skill before executing; team-custom skills should retain recoverable source files.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Why isn't the Agent using the skill after installation? </summary>

First, confirm the skill is not globally disabled. Then, enable it in the [Skills] section of the Agent edit window, or ask the Agent to help you complete the binding. Finally, send a new message to test.

<summary>Can skills contain programs? </summary>

Skill packages can contain instructions, resources, and scripts. Whether scripts can be executed depends on the Agent's tools, working directory, environment dependencies, and permission mode.
