# Coding Partner (Code CLI)

【Coding Partner】is used to install, configure, and launch common programming command-line tools. Cherry Studio distinguishes between app-managed versions, versions already present in the system PATH, and the tool's own account login. It does not automatically overwrite system installations.

<figure><img src="../../../../assets/2e66cc9312c27cf740b2eb62.webp" alt="CLI list, installation status, and model service configuration on the Coding Partner page"><figcaption><p>① Select the tool on the left and confirm its installation status; ② Select the Unified Gateway, the tool's official account, or a compatible model service on the right. </p></figcaption></figure>

### What the Page Can Do

* Check if a tool is installed and if updates are available;
* Install, update, or remove Cherry Studio-managed tool copies;
* Detect tools already present in the system PATH;
* Select a provider, model, and parameters for CLIs that require model services;
* Preserve native login methods for CLIs that use their own account login;
* Select a working directory and a system-detected terminal to launch.

The page includes tools such as Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Kimi Code, Qoder CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Pi, and DeepSeek Harness. The actual visible items may change with product updates; refer to the page list for the current status.

### General Launch Process

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### 1. Open 【Coding Partner】 from 【Launchpad】

Select the required tool and check whether its status is Not Installed, Managed by Cherry Studio, or from the System.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### 2. Complete Installation or Login

If not installed, click 【Install】. For CLIs that provide their own account login, follow the page prompts to complete native login. You do not need to select a provider from Cherry Studio.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### 3. Configure Model Connection

For tools that require Cherry Studio model services, you can select 【Unified Gateway】 or a compatible provider and model. The page filters by the interface type required by the CLI; incompatible providers are not listed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### 4. Select Directory and Terminal

The working directory determines where the CLI launches. The terminal can only be selected from the list detected by the system; after launching, use read-only commands first to confirm the current path.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### 5. Launch and Verify

Click 【Launch】, confirm that the account or model is correct, then execute file modifications or commands. If you need to adjust reasoning intensity, permissions, or tool-specific options, open 【Configuration】.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### DeepSeek Harness

<figure><img src="../../../../assets/ceedc835426c7413a36609ba.webp" alt="DeepSeek Harness installation and unified gateway configuration in Coding Partner"><figcaption><p>① If not installed, complete the managed installation first; after installation, configure the compatible provider, default permissions, and Agent mode, then launch the Web UI. </p></figcaption></figure>

The process for DeepSeek Harness differs from standard terminal CLIs: after installation and provider selection, it is run under Cherry Studio management, and a standalone Web UI can be opened. In the parameters, you can select the default Agent mode and default permissions:

| Configuration | Suitable For | Notes |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| 【Standard】 | May use files, Shell, retrieval, skills, planning, and sub-agents | Largest tool surface; use controlled permissions first |
| 【PTC Code】 | Requires combining multi-step tool operations via Code Mode | Better suited for complex coding tasks |
| 【Minimal】 | Only requires persistent Shell and text editor | Fewer dependencies, smaller capability scope |
| 【Read-Only】 | Inspect projects without writing files | Risky operations still request confirmation |
| 【Workspace Write】 | Allows modifying the current DSH workspace | Does not imply access to files outside the workspace |
| 【Full Access】 | Isolated, trusted, and recoverable environments | Does not request operation confirmation; highest risk |

### Distinguish Installation Sources

| Source | What Cherry Studio Does | How You Should Maintain It |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Cherry Studio Managed | Installs, updates, and uninstalls the corresponding managed copy | Manage in 【Coding Partner】 or 【Environment Dependencies】 |
| System PATH | Detects and uses directly, without overwriting | Update or uninstall using the original package manager |
| Tool Official Account | Preserves the tool's own login flow | Manage account and authorization in the tool's interface |

{% hint style="warning" %}
After uninstalling the Cherry Studio managed copy, if a same-named executable file still exists in the system, the page will automatically fall back to the system version. When behavior changes, first confirm which source is currently being used.
{% endhint %}

### User Case: Launching Coding Tools in a Project Directory

Developers first select the current project directory, choose a verified model connection, and then launch Pi or another CLI. The first command only reads the repository status; after confirming the account, model, and directory are correct, allow the tool to modify files and run checks.

<summary>Why can't I find an already installed terminal or CLI? </summary>

Cherry Studio detects tools from the login environment and standard locations. Ensure the command runs in the login terminal, then restart the app to refresh the environment. Portable or non-standard paths currently require manual launch from that terminal.
