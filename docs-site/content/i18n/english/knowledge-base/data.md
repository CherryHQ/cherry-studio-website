Vector Database: [https://turso.tech/libsql](https://turso.tech/libsql)

After a document is added to the Cherry Studio knowledge base, the file will be split into several fragments, which will then be processed by the embedding model.

When using a large model for Q&A, text fragments related to the question will be queried and passed to the large language model for processing.

If you have data privacy requirements, it is recommended to use a local embedding database and a local large language model.
