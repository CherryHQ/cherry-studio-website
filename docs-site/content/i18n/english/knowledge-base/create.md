# Create a Knowledge Base

The two most important choices when creating a knowledge base are the name and the embedding model. You can add materials later, but the name defines the scope, and the retrieval method affects future maintenance.

{% hint style="info" %}
For your first experience, set the **Embedding Model** to **None**. The knowledge base will still use BM25 keyword retrieval, which is sufficient to test the import and recall workflow.
{% endhint %}

## Make Two Decisions Before Creating

### Name the Scope Clearly

Use a format of "Object + Purpose," such as **Employee Travel Policy**, **Product After-Sales Manual**, or **Market Research Materials**. Avoid vague names like **Materials** or **Test**, which make it difficult to determine the content scope later.

### Choose the Embedding Method

| Option | Suitable Scenario | Retrieval Method | Prerequisites |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| None | First-time use, clear keywords | BM25 keyword retrieval | None |
| Cloud Embedding Model | User queries differ significantly from source text | BM25 + Vector hybrid retrieval | The corresponding model service must be callable |
| Local Embedding Model | Vectorization must happen locally | BM25 + Local vector retrieval | Download the model in **Local Models** first |

## Creation Steps

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### 1. Open the Creation Window

Open **Knowledge Base** in the left navigation and click the add button above the knowledge base list.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Enter a Name

Enter a name that clearly defines the scope, such as **Employee Travel Policy**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Select an Embedding Model

Select an available cloud or local embedding model. If you do not need semantic retrieval yet, select **None**.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Click Create

Confirm the name and model, then click **Create**. After creation, you will enter the empty knowledge base.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 5. Add the First Batch of Materials

Click the add materials button, import one or two files or notes with clear answers, and wait for processing to complete.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Using a Local Embedding Model

Open **Settings** → **Local Models** and download an available model in the **Embedding Models** section. The displayed models and download sizes may vary depending on the installation environment; refer to the current list.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Using a local embedding model only means vectorization happens locally. Whether document parsing, reranking, and chat use cloud services depends on the respective service and model selections.
{% endhint %}

## Changing Models After Adding Materials

When enabling an embedding model for a knowledge base that previously used only BM25, a vector index can be built. When changing the embedding model for a knowledge base that already has vectors, the interface will enter the **Rebuild Knowledge Base** workflow.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before starting the rebuild, ensure the new model is callable. After rebuilding, complete the recall test again. Do not change the model and modify chunking in the same round, as this makes it impossible to determine the source of result changes.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration Notes

| Configuration Item | Product Default | Recommended Start | Function | Applicable Scenario | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Name | Empty | Object + Purpose | Distinguishes material scope | All knowledge bases | Separate materials with different permissions or lifecycles |
| Embedding Model | None | Start with None for first-time use | Determines if vector retrieval is included | Colloquial queries, many synonyms | Cloud model billing and data processing depend on the provider |
| Local Embedding Model | Not downloaded | Download when local processing is needed | Vectorization happens locally | Offline or high privacy requirements | Still need to check parsing, reranking, and chat models separately |

## Expected Results

* The new knowledge base appears in the list with a name distinct from others.
* You clearly know whether you are using keyword retrieval or hybrid retrieval.
* The selected cloud model is callable, or the local model has been downloaded.

## User Case

Xiao Lin created the **Employee Travel Policy** knowledge base for the first time. He first selected **None** for the embedding model, imported three policy documents, and completed the recall test. After keyword queries became stable, he configured an embedding model and compared results for colloquial queries using the same questions.

The completion standard is: after upgrading the retrieval method, the original fixed questions do not degrade, and colloquial queries can more stably find the same policy.

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>What if the Create button is unavailable?</summary>

Check if the name is empty and if the selected model is still available. If the model service is not configured, you can switch to **None** to complete the creation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will not using an embedding model result in no search results?</summary>

No. The knowledge base will still use BM25 keyword retrieval. The closer the query wording is to the materials, the more stable the results usually are.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I need to create a separate knowledge base for each topic?</summary>

Use "should they be retrieved together during use" as the criterion. Materials with completely different permissions, lifecycles, or topics are better separated.
