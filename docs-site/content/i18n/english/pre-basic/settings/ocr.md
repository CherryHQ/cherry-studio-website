# OCR

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) converts **text in images into copyable text that AI can read**. The following scenarios rely on it:

* Dragging a screenshot or scanned document into the chat box so the AI can read the text
* Adding image-based invoices or documents to the [Knowledge Base](../../knowledge-base/knowledge-base.md) for future search
* An [Agent](../../advanced-basic/agent.md) opening a local image for analysis

OCR has a dedicated settings page. Configure the recognition engine once in **Settings** → **OCR**, and all image text recognition features will use the same configuration.

### Selecting the Recognition Engine

Use the dropdown in the top-right corner of the panel to switch OCR engines. **The selected engine becomes the default**. Built-in engines:

| Engine | Integration / Runtime | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **System OCR** | Offline, no configuration required | Uses system-native recognition (macOS Live Text / Windows OCR); ready to use and fastest |
| **PaddleOCR** | Enter API key ([PaddlePaddle Galaxy Community](https://aistudio.baidu.com/paddleocr/)); if self-hosted, point the API address to your service. Optional parsing model | Avoids local resource usage while leveraging Paddle's recognition quality |
| **Local PaddleOCR** | Offline; requires downloading the local OCR model (approx. 140MB) in **Settings** → **Local Models** first | Excellent Chinese recognition, runs entirely locally, privacy-first |
| **Tesseract OCR** | Offline, built-in | Classic open-source OCR, supports multiple languages, good fallback option |
| **Mistral** | Mistral API key | Leverages multimodal LLMs for smarter recognition of complex layouts / handwriting |
| **Intel OV OCR** | Local runtime (Intel OpenVINO, NPU acceleration) | **Only appears on Windows + Intel Core Ultra (with NPU) when OV models are deployed**; hidden on other devices |

{% hint style="success" %}
Not sure which to choose? Start with **System OCR**—it handles most screenshots and clear scans without any configuration. Switch to Local PaddleOCR or Mistral if recognition quality is insufficient.
{% endhint %}

When System OCR is selected, the panel displays <mark style="color:green;">macOS Live Text / Windows OCR engine detected</mark> (if the system does not support it, this option will not appear in the dropdown).

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Before selecting "Local PaddleOCR", download the "Local OCR Model" in **Settings** → **Local Models**, otherwise it cannot be invoked.
* **Tesseract** (and System OCR on Windows) allows selecting target languages via the "Language" dropdown in the panel.
{% endhint %}

### Difference from Document Processing

Many people confuse OCR with [Document Processing](doc-process.md). Here is the distinction:

* **OCR**: Handles text recognition in **images / scans** (Image → Text).
* **Document Processing**: Handles structured parsing of **PDFs / complex layout documents** (PDFs with tables/multi-columns → Clean text).

They are independent and configured separately. Text paragraphs in plain text PDFs, `.md`/`.txt`/`.docx` are read directly without passing through either process.
