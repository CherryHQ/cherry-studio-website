# Environment Dependencies

Environment Dependencies is used to **manage the binary tools and runtimes required for Cherry Studio to execute certain advanced features**. Some capabilities of [MCP services](../../advanced-basic/extensions/mcp), [Skills](../../advanced-basic/extensions/skills.md), and [Agents](../../advanced-basic/agent.md) rely on underlying command-line tools such as `uv` and `bun`. Cherry Studio centralizes these here, so you do not need to manually install and configure them via the command line.

Open `Settings → Dependencies` (under **System**):

### Built-in and Installable

Each tool is displayed as a card with a status indicator:

* Tools marked with <mark style="color:blue;">**Built-in**</mark> are distributed with Cherry Studio and are ready to use out of the box, requiring no action.
* Uninstalled tools display an **Install** button on their card. Clicking it allows Cherry Studio to automatically download and install the tool into the application directory, without polluting your system environment.
* Cards provide links to the source repository and official documentation, as well as an entry point to open the local installation directory.

Overview of common tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **uv** | Python package management tool for MCP services and dependency installation |
| **Bun** | JavaScript runtime used by MCP services and related toolchains |
| **fd** | Fast file search tool, a replacement for `find` |
| **ripgrep (rg)** | Fast text search tool, a replacement for `grep` |
| **RTK** | CLI proxy tool that compresses terminal output to reduce LLM token consumption |
| **Lark CLI** | Official Lark CLI covering 200+ commands for messages, documents, multi-dimensional tables, calendars, etc. |

The page also lists tools such as `gh` (GitHub CLI), `ntn` (Notion CLI), and `pi` in cards, which can be installed with one click as needed. (Coding CLIs like Claude Code / Codex are managed on the [Code Mate](../../cherrystudio/preview/code-cli.md) page, not here.)

### Add Tool

The "**Add Tool**" button in the top-right corner uses the mise tool key to add tools outside the built-in list (e.g., `github:sharkdp/fd`, `uv`, `bun`).

### Advanced Installation Settings

Click the settings icon in the top-right corner to open "**Advanced Installation Settings**" to fine-tune how tools are downloaded (all fields can be left empty to use defaults):

* **GitHub Mirror**: Adds a proxy prefix for GitHub Release downloads (e.g., `https://ghfast.top`), useful when direct connections are unstable.
* **GitHub Token**: Increases the GitHub API rate limit when querying tools (stored in plaintext locally).
* **npm Mirror / pip Index URL**: Sets mirrors for `npm:` / `pipx:` type tools (if left empty, a mirror is automatically selected for users in mainland China).
* **Verify Tool Signatures**: Verifies Sigstore / SLSA signatures for tools; generally recommended to keep enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
Most users do not need to operate here directly—when a specific tool is required, the relevant feature (such as installing an MCP service) will typically guide you back here for one-click installation. This page serves more as an entry point for "runtime environment health checks and completion."
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an MCP service or Skill reports an error indicating "uv / bun / command not found," first check here to confirm whether the corresponding tool is installed or in "Built-in" status (installation status refreshes automatically; the button in the top-right corner is **Check for Updates**, used to fetch the latest versions of tools).
{% endhint %}
