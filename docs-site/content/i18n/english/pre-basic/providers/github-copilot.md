## Frequently Asked Questions

### Failed to Obtain Device Code, Please Retry

Currently, requests are built using Axios, which does not support SOCKS proxies. Please use a system proxy or HTTP proxy, or do not set a proxy directly in CherryStudio and use a global proxy instead. First, please ensure your network connection is normal to avoid failures in obtaining the Device Code.
