# Moonshot AI (Kimi)

Moonshot AI builds the **Kimi** models, known for very long context windows — well suited to large documents and codebases. International users sign up on the global platform, platform.moonshot.ai.

## Get API Key

* Sign up on the [Moonshot AI Platform](https://platform.moonshot.ai/) (mainland China users: [platform.moonshot.cn](https://platform.moonshot.cn/))
* Go to **API Keys** and create a `sk-...` key
* Top up your balance before first use

## Configure in Cherry Studio

* Open `Settings → Model Provider`, find **Moonshot AI** and open its page
* Click **Add API key**, paste your `sk-...` key, then click **Save and close**
* Make sure the **API Host** matches the platform your key comes from: `https://api.moonshot.ai` for the global platform, `https://api.moonshot.cn` for mainland China
* Click **Sync models** and add the Kimi models you want (for example **Kimi K2.5**)

## Suitable Scenarios

* **Long PDFs and documents**: Kimi's long context is where it stands out
* **Large code reviews**: send whole files at once without splitting them
* **Book-length summaries**: no need to chunk the text by hand

{% hint style="info" %}
* Moonshot offers context caching, which can cut token costs for repeated conversations; see its official documentation
* Using Kimi through Cherry Studio lets you combine it with assistants, knowledge bases and MCP tools
