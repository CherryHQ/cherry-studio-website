# SearXNG Local Deployment and Configuration

CherryStudio supports network search through SearXNG. SearXNG is an open-source project that can be deployed locally or on a server, so its configuration method is slightly different from others that require API providers.

**SearXNG Project Link**: [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng)

## Advantages of SearXNG

*   Open source and free, no API required
*   Relatively high privacy
*   Highly customizable

## Local Deployment

### 1. Direct Deployment with Docker

Since SearXNG does not require complex environment configuration and can be deployed by simply providing an available port without docker compose, the quickest way is to directly pull the image with Docker for deployment.

#### 1. Download, install, and configure [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Server Deployment

Given that installing Docker on Windows can be quite troublesome, users can deploy SearXNG on a server and share it with others. However, unfortunately, SearXNG itself does not currently support authentication, which could lead to others scanning and misusing your deployed instance through technical means.

To address this, Cherry Studio currently supports configuring [HTTP Basic Authentication (RFC7617)](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication). If you intend to expose your deployed SearXNG to the public network, it is **essential** to configure HTTP Basic Authentication using reverse proxy software like Nginx. A brief tutorial is provided below, assuming you have basic Linux operation and maintenance knowledge.

### Deploying SearXNG

Similarly, deployment still uses Docker. Assuming you have installed the latest Docker CE on your server according to the [official tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install), here are one-stop commands suitable for a fresh installation on a Debian system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y

# Pull the official repository
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git
cd /opt/searxng-docker

# If your server bandwidth is small, you can set this to false
export IMAGE_PROXY=true

# Modify configuration file
cat <<EOF > /opt/searxng-docker/searxng/settings.yml
# see https://docs.searxng.org/admin/settings/settings.html#settings-use-default-settings
use_default_settings: true
server:
  # base_url is defined in the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable, see .env and docker-compose.yml
  secret_key: $(openssl rand -hex 32)
  limiter: false  # can be disabled for a private instance
  image_proxy: $IMAGE_PROXY
ui:
  static_use_hash: true
redis:
  url: redis://redis:6379/0
search:
  formats:
    - html
    - json
EOF
```

If you need to modify the local listening port or reuse an existing Nginx instance locally, you can edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
# If you don't need Caddy and want to reuse an existing Nginx locally, remove the following. We don't need Caddy by default.
  caddy:
    container_name: caddy
    image: docker.io/library/caddy:2-alpine
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro
      - caddy-data:/data:rw
      - caddy-config:/config:rw
    environment:

        max-file: "1"

  searxng:
    container_name: searxng

      - searxng
    # Default mapping to host port 8080. If you want to listen on 8000, change it to "127.0.0.1:8000:8080"
    ports:

    logging:

      options:

        max-file: "1"

networks:

Execute `docker compose up -d` to start. Execute `docker compose logs -f searxng` to view logs.

### Deploy Nginx Reverse Proxy and HTTP Basic Authentication

If you use server panel programs, such as Baota Panel or 1Panel, please refer to their documentation to add a website and configure Nginx reverse proxy. Then, locate where to modify the Nginx configuration file, and modify it according to the example below:

```conf
server
{
    listen 443 ssl;

    # This line is your hostname
    server_name search.example.com;

    # index index.html;
    # root /data/www/default;

    # If SSL is configured, these two lines should be present
    ssl_certificate    /path/to/your/cert/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key    /path/to/your/cert/privkey.pem;

    # HSTS
    # add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload";

    # By default, when configuring reverse proxy via the panel, the default location block looks like this
    location / {
        # Just add the following two lines to the location block; keep everything else as is.
        # This example assumes your configuration file is saved in the /etc/nginx/conf.d/ directory.
        # If using Baota, it should be saved in directories like /www; pay attention to this.
        auth_basic "Please enter your username and password";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/search.htpasswd;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_protocol_addr;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        client_max_body_size 0;
    }

    # access_log  ...;
    # error_log  ...;
}
```

Assuming the Nginx configuration file is saved under `/etc/nginx/conf.d`, we will save the password file in the same directory.

Execute the command (replace `example_name` and `example_password` with the username and password you intend to set):

```bash
echo "example_name:$(openssl passwd -5 'example_password')" > /etc/nginx/conf.d/search.htpasswd
```

Restart Nginx (reloading the configuration also works).

Now you can open the webpage, and it will prompt you to enter your username and password. Please enter the username and password you set earlier to see if you can successfully access the SearXNG search page, thereby checking if the configuration is correct.

## Cherry Studio Related Configuration

After SearXNG is successfully deployed locally or on a server, the next step is CherryStudio's related configuration.

Go to the network search settings page and select Searxng:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/320df59f8a1726a1ad711483.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If entering the locally deployed link results in verification failure, don't worry:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/84394efb52fd620e87b4be56.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Because the JSON return type is not configured by default after direct deployment, data cannot be fetched, and the configuration file needs to be modified.

Go back to Docker, navigate to the Files tab, and find the tagged folder within the image:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/c60179784ede7bfc8e494149.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Expand it and scroll down further; you will find another tagged folder:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/1f1f1979eff7079b81e44712.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Continue expanding and locate the **settings.yml** configuration file:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/b5404fe79eedd68313f52e50.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click to open the file editor:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/256b0f0b130cd6a0675dbf68.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Go to line 78; you will see that only `html` is listed as a type

<figure><img src="../../../assets/73dae19728e0277674c00972.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Add the `json` type, save, and restart the image

<figure><img src="../../../assets/502cd1dfbd21b235e6ad930e.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../assets/6a338a946c3d09f4c0a85280.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Return to Cherry Studio to verify; verification successful:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/09ba5a8e53909465e8b82a3a.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The address can be filled in as local: [http://localhost](http://localhost) : port number\
or as the Docker address: [http://host.docker.internal](http://host.docker.internal) : port number

If the user followed the previous example for server deployment and correctly configured the reverse proxy, and has enabled the JSON return type. After entering the address and verifying, since HTTP Basic Authentication has been configured for the reverse proxy, verification should now return a 401 error code:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/bfbbd576e166a5b3c91459da.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Configure HTTP Basic Authentication in the client, enter the username and password set earlier:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/bae78c4b90bb9bf592e3df6d.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Proceed with verification; it should be successful.

### Other Configurations

At this point, SearXNG has default internet search capabilities. If you need to customize search engines, you must configure them yourself.

It should be noted that the preferences here do not affect the configuration when large models are invoked.

<figure><img src="../../../assets/2f90523a92a6e8faee642306.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To configure search engines that require large model invocation, you need to set them in the configuration file:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/bac57409b07fe4274bb7b557.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../assets/7af6ac822e82923466bd47ad.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Configuration language reference:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/00af4cfe633cb13aaab9064b.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the content is too long and inconvenient to modify directly, you can copy it to a local IDE, modify it, and then paste it back into the configuration file.

## Common Reasons for Verification Failure

### Return format not including JSON format

Add `json` to the return format in the configuration file:

<figure><img src="../../../assets/e1254790f7d2b06d59aac1fc.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Search engine not configured correctly

Cherry Studio defaults to selecting engines that include both 'web' and 'general' categories for searching. By default, engines like Google are selected, which leads to failure as Google and similar websites are not directly accessible in mainland China. Adding the following configuration to force SearXNG to use the Baidu engine can resolve this issue:

```
use_default_settings:
  engines:
    keep_only:
      - baidu
engines:
  - name: baidu
    engine: baidu 
    categories: 
      - web
      - general
    disabled: false
```

### Access rate too fast

SearXNG's `limiter` configuration is hindering API access. Please try setting it to `false` in the settings:
