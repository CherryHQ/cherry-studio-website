# Contributing Code

A code contribution starts with a clearly defined problem. Before fixing a bug, confirm you can reproduce it; before adding a feature, describe the user scenario and expected behavior. For larger changes, we recommend agreeing on the direction in a GitHub Issue or Discussion first.

## Before You Start

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cherry Studio repository</strong></td><td>Source code, README and development entry points</td><td><a href="https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio">https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>GitHub Issues</strong></td><td>Bugs, feature suggestions and open problems</td><td><a href="https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/issues">https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/issues</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Contributing guide</strong></td><td>Branch, testing, sign-off and review requirements</td><td><a href="https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></td><td>Ground rules for community collaboration</td><td><a href="https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

Good starter tasks can be found under the `good first issue`, `help wanted` and `kind/bug` labels. Before you begin, say in the Issue that you plan to work on it, so several people don't duplicate the effort.

## Choosing a Branch

Most current features, fixes, refactors and optimizations go to `main`. If the Issue, a maintainer or the contributing guide specifies a different target branch, follow the project's instructions at that time — don't decide based on old tutorials alone.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't pick the target branch based on old tutorials. Check the repository's current contributing guide and PR template again before opening a PR; if the branching strategy changes, the repository is the source of truth.
{% endhint %}

## When Contributing Code Makes Sense

| Situation | Recommended approach |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| A problem you can reproduce reliably | Submit a minimal fix with a matching check first |
| A small feature with clear boundaries | Confirm the requirement and target branch before implementing |
| Involves data migration, permissions or architecture | Agree on the approach in an Issue or Discussion first |
| Only the wording or screenshots need to change | Go through **Contributing Docs** — don't mix it into a code PR |

{% hint style="info" %}
One PR should solve one clear problem. If a change mixes features, refactoring and unrelated formatting, reviewers find it hard to judge the risk, and it's harder to roll back.
{% endhint %}

## Submission Process

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### 1. Fork and create a branch

Create a clearly scoped working branch from the correct target branch. One PR covers one topic — don't mix in opportunistic refactors or formatting changes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Set up the development environment

Follow the repository's **Developer Guide** to install the specified Node.js and pnpm versions, then run `pnpm install`. Before changing anything, run the existing checks for the module you're working on to confirm the baseline passes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Make and verify your changes

Bug fixes should add a test that reproduces the problem; new features should cover the key paths and failure cases. Before committing, run the formatting, static analysis, test and build checks the repository requires.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Commit and sign off

Write commit messages that state the type of change and the module, and add a DCO sign-off with `git commit --signoff`. Signing off means you have the right to submit this content under the project's license.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 5. Open a PR

Fill in the template: before and after, why you chose this approach, trade-offs and alternatives, breaking changes, how you verified it, and the Release Note. Changes that still need discussion can start as a Draft PR.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## After Submitting a PR

PRs from new contributors start with the `needs-ok-to-test` label, and automated tests don't start right away. Once a repository member confirms, they use `/ok-to-test` to start the pipeline. Draft PRs aren't assigned regular reviewers and skip automated tests; mark them Ready for review when they're ready.

Address review comments with new commits to keep the discussion context. When there's a design disagreement, go back to the user problem and verifiable behavior rather than sidestepping a local issue with a large rewrite.

## Pre-Submission Checklist

* The target branch is correct;
* The scope of the change matches the Issue / PR description;
* New behavior has tests or repeatable manual verification steps;
* User-visible changes are reflected in the documentation;
* Data migration, upgrades and compatibility have been considered;
* No API keys, real user data or debug files are committed;
* Commits are signed off and the Release Note follows the template.

<summary>Do small changes need an Issue too?</summary>

Typos and obvious small fixes can be submitted directly; for anything touching product behavior, architecture or a larger amount of work, opening an Issue first makes it easier to confirm the direction. Whether an Issue is required follows the repository's current maintenance rules.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why didn't CI run automatically?</summary>

First make sure the PR isn't a Draft. PRs from new contributors need a repository member to comment `/ok-to-test`; if you see `needs-ok-to-test`, just wait for confirmation on the PR.
